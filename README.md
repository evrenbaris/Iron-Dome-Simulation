# Iron Dome Simulation

This project simulates a simplified Iron Dome defense system using Python. The system launches defense rockets to intercept multiple incoming threat rockets. The simulation includes visualization of rocket trajectories, collision detection, and defense zone representation.

## Features
- **Multiple Threat and Defense Rockets**:
  - Simulates multiple threat rockets with random start and target positions.
  - Defense rockets are launched to intercept each threat rocket.
- **Collision Detection**:
  - Defense rockets collide with threat rockets and neutralize them upon contact.
- **Visualization**:
  - Visualizes the defense zone, rocket trajectories, and collision points.
  - Clearly identifies the launch pad and active rockets.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib
- IPython (for animations in Jupyter or Google Colab)

## How to Run
### Option 1: Python Script
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iron-dome-simulation.git
